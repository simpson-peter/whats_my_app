# What's My App
What's My App serves you dumb app names all day long.

It's a single-serving website created by [Peter Simpson](petersimpson.me) using Flutter Web. Any resemblance to real-life apps is entirely coincidental, but feel free to take a name if you like.

## Design
What's My App is implemented in Dart and utilizes the Flutter framework's web functionality.
The site exists within a single large widget, `MainPage`, which loads differing internal content to display to the user based on the current state.

What's My App also allows the user to share original content through a "Share on Twitter" button that I created for use on this site.

## Repository Contents
The majority of the files in this repository are generated by the flutter framework to control app production. The files and directories which are unique to this project are:

 - `lib/`
 - `pubspec.yaml`
 - `README.md` *(You are here)*
 
`pubspec.yaml` lists the project dependencies, which can be loaded through running a `pub get` command.

**`lib/`** contains the website source code. 


## Known Issues
None as of now, but as always submit issues or pull requests if you find any!
